# Here is "Weather App" based on React

Pretty simple app, with little of functions and not very good design (but i am not positioning myself as a good designer), so main impact was in functionality.

## APIs that was used here

- Weather API - [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/);
- City API - [API Ninjas - City API](https://api-ninjas.com/api/city);

## Base functionalIty includes:
- City search - can find every city around the world (limited by City API power);
- Current weather - you can see it as a main part of your home screen;
- Today hourly weather - weather of each our of today, with gap of 1, 2, 3 or 5 (can be changed on settings). You can find it right under the current weather pad;
-  Weekly weather - weather of each day for 7 next days, right part of screen on home page;
- Last visited cities page - displays last 7 cities you watched;
- Settings page - pretty simple general settings to be comfortable for every user;

`Note: accurancy of data depends on Open-Meteo and their API, we are not recomend this resourse for real use, just as a display of author's skills in working with React and APIs.`
